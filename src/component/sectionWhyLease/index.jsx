              How Does Leasing Work?
            </h2>
            <p className="how-does__text">
              Leasing a vehicle is essentially entering into a long term rental
              agreement for that vehicle. Unlike a traditional car purchase, you
              donâ€™t actually own the vehicle. Instead, a leasing company
              purchases the vehicle from the dealer on your behalf and then you
              make monthly payments to the leasing company for the duration of
              your lease. Some leases however, do provide the option to purchase
              the vehicle at the end of the lease.
            </p>
            <h4 className="how-does__title  text-xl font-bold pt-6 mb-4">
              Similar to a short term car rental, there are rules that define:
            </h4>
            <ol className="how-does-list pt-12 pb-16 ">
              <li className="how-does-item">
                How much you can drive, stated as annual miles (excess miles are
                charged at a specified rate)
              </li>
              <li className="how-does-item">
                Types of damage that you may be liable for at the end of your
                lease
              </li>
              <li className="how-does-item">
                The procedures and costs when you return the vehicle at the end
                of your lease
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p className="how-does__text">
              Lease contracts are a commitment and ending them early can be
              difficult and expensive so it is important to consider your
              circumstances carefully before you decide.
